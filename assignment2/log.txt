Assume lnxsrv09 to be the "client" and lnxsrv07 to be the "server"
Sign into the client side by typing  ssh username@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu and entering your password 
Type ls -a in order to see whether or not their exists a .ssh directory
-if it doesn't, type mkdir .ssh 
proceed to make .ssh the current directory by typing cd .ssh 
generate a SSH key by typing the command ssh-keygen and you will be prompted to give the file a name of your choosing 
following this, you will be asked to create a passphrase, make sure you remember this! This is used to secure your private key 
Type ls to make sure that you have a public and private key in this directory 
Sign into the server side by typing ssh username@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu and enter your password when prompted to 
When need to get the public key on the server, but luckily the SEASnet servers share file, so we don't need to do anything here
Now, we need to create an authorized_keys file under the .ssh directory by typing touch authorized_keys
Enter chmod 600 authorized_keys to assure the permissions of the file are correct
Now, we need to append the contents of the public key file to the authorized_keys file 
This can be done by typing the command cat NameOfPublicKeyFile.pub >> authorized_keys
Now, go back to your client server and enter ssh -i <relative_path_to_private_key>  username@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu 
This should allow you to ssh between client and server by entering your passphrase 
Now from your client side, we will make use of ssh-agent by entering eval `ssh-agent` to which you should see Agent pid #####, which assures that the process has began running. 
Next, we add our key to ssh-agent by typing ssh-add 35Lweek2 and you should be prompted to type your passphrase 
Now, we log into the server by typing ssh -i <relative_path_to_private_key> username@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
This should log you into the server with no password/passphrase prompt
In order to enable port-forwarding, I downloaded XQuartz and on terminal I logged in using ssh -X gurbir@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
I then typed in xeyes to test it out
In order to allow for Multi-Hop SSH, to do this in one command line, you must log into lnxsrv09 with the following command to allow agent forwarding: ssh -A gurbir@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu 
Then, cd .ssh and enter the commands eval `ssh-agent` and ssh-add 35Lweek2 and enter you passphrase
Once you have done this, in order to jump to lnxsrv09 to lnxsrv10 while jumping through lnxsrv07, enter the command: 
 ssh -A -t gurbir@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t gurbir@lnxsrv10.seas.ucla.edu
Now you should be on lnxsrv10 with a starting point of lnxsrv09 and a midpoint of lnxsrv07. I confirmed this by exititng and saw that it exited from lnxsrv10 and lnxsrv07.
